# deep-learning-project-brain-tumor-segmentation
Project for deep learning course, finding brain tumors using image segmentation by use of the U-Net model architecture.

Provided in this repo are some of the saved models we made after training during experimentations of deviations from our base model, as well as the baseline model saved in increments of 5 epoch training runs, for verification of performance increase in the incrementation of 5 epochs.

The code for both our failed PyTorch notebook and our working Keras model is provided
